## ðŸ†• Additional Recommended Tasks

### ðŸ”„ Technical Fixes & Optimizations
- [ ] Add a **global error handler** (e.g., `ErrorBoundary`)
- [ ] Add **network connection detection** (e.g., to show a toast if the user goes offline)
- [ ] Implement **SafeAreaView** across all screens (for iOS notch/safe areas)

---

### ðŸ”„ Feature Implementation
- [x] Add **basic profile setup flow** right after registration (collect profile info step-by-step)
- [ ] Add **block/report user** functionality for safety
- [ ] Add **profile visibility toggle** (allow user to go invisible)

---

### ðŸ”„ UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Add **Lottie animations** for empty states or match success

---

### ðŸ”„ Backend Integration (Future)
- [ ] Add **admin dashboard link** or token-based access to manual match panel (even just a placeholder)
- [ ] Define **API contract/schema** for future backend work
- [ ] Decide backend stack: Firebase vs Supabase vs custom

---

### ðŸ”„ Testing & QA
- [ ] Add **manual QA checklist** (e.g., install on real Android/iOS device, test offline mode, test keyboard)
- [ ] Test UI/UX on small and large devices (different resolutions)
